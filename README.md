## Quizler

Hi there, Quizler is a web app which lets you easily create, share, and do quizes.
Quizler is part of college assignment/project and a work in progress and will heavily change over time. It uses react.js on the frontend and will probably be powered by sails.js on the backend.

## Installation

At this point just clone the git repository and open up index.html in your favorite browser.

## Usage

So far there is not much functionality to quizler. I'm just about to add it.
