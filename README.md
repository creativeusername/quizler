## Quizler

Hi there, Quizler is a web app which lets you easily create, share, and do quizes.
Quizler is part of college assignment/project and a work in progress and will heavily change over time. It uses react.js on the frontend and will probably be powered by sails.js on the backend.

## Installation

Clone the repository into some place you like

`git clone https://github.com/creativeusername/quizler.git `

Install the needed dependencies through npm and build the bundle.js file for the first time.

```
npm install
npm build
```

## Usage

Start watching files for changes with `npm start`. A new bundle.js file will be build every time you save an update.
